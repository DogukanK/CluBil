<b>:clipboard: Project Description:</b> 
CluBil, is a project to create a medium to establish efficiently communication between students and student clubs.

<b>For Students:</b>
Students, with pre-existing credentials, will be able to login their account as students and edit all of their profile details including an avatar and some description or contact information. Students will be able to join clubs and activities and have dashboards where they will be able to search and filter for the activity/club of their interest. They will also have an inbox-like page where they can see the private invitations ( e.g brainstorming sessions, teambuiding activities ) from the club.

<b>For clubs:</b>
Club accounts will also use their pre-defined credentials to login the system. They have a more detailed profile/about page, including their information, purpose, contact information, recent/upcoming events and activity charts. Clubs can add/delete events, remove participants from clubs and send private event invitations to club participants. They can track the information about how many people signed up for the event and add quotas to the events.
There will be also a sysadmin account in place, for use in situations where manual intervention (blocking accounts, removing clubs creation of accounts and etc.) is needed.

<b>Additional functions:</b>
- Notifications before registered 
- Avatar adding for event/club/student
- Charts of activity for each club
- Event info quotas recorded and can be tracked
